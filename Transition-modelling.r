#* assumptions:
#* 
#* 1. Assumption: Sustained Effect:
#     * Some interventions maintain their impact consistently over time. For instance:
#         * A vaccination program may continue to protect individuals against a specific disease.
#         * Regular exercise might have a steady positive effect on health outcomes.
#     * Reference: Transient study of Markov models with time-dependent transition rates discusses modelling time-dependent rates in various contexts.
# 2. Assumption: Diminishing Returns:
#     * Interventions with high initial impact may experience diminishing returns. Initially, they lead to substantial improvements, but over time, the incremental benefit decreases.
#     * For example, a new drug may dramatically reduce mortality initially, but its effectiveness might plateau.
#     * Reference: Estimating Markov Transition Matrices Using Proportions Data explores credit risk models with time-dependent transition rates.
# 3. Assumption: Adaptive Behavior:
#     * Individuals may adapt their behaviour based on interventions. For instance:
#         * Awareness campaigns might lead to healthier lifestyle choices initially, but people may revert to old habits.
#         * Economic incentives (e.g., subsidies for healthy foods) may influence behaviour temporarily.
#     * Reference: Markov Analysis â€“ A Brief Introduction discusses assumptions related to transitions.
# 4. Assumption: Lagged Effects:
#     * Some interventions may have delayed effects. Consider:
#         * Smoking cessation might take years to significantly reduce mortality.
#         * Environmental policies may impact health outcomes after a lag.
#     * Reference: A Procedure for Deriving Formulas to Convert Transition Rates provides formulas for converting rates.
# 5. Assumption: Steady Ongoing risk over time
#     * People have a steady ongoing risk over time, and thus health programs will have steady effects to reduce mortality.
#     * Even if someone makes bold changes to their lifestyle due to health initiatives, mortality effects will steadily increase/decrease.
#     * Reference: On the Use of Markov Models in Pharmacoeconomics: Pros and Cons and Implications for Policy Makers
# 6. Assumption: Time homogeneity of health programs
#     * The effectiveness of the health programs that we have chosen will remain steady over time.
#     * For example, the effectiveness of smoking cessation campaigns will neither improve or be impaired
